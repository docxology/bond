# Bond Ops — QUARTERMASTER

*infra package · mission codename QUARTERMASTER*.

## Concepts

Fleet inventory, gates, health, provisioning

## Abstract (imported from the package manuscript)

PROJECT BOND is a ****-package research suite: **** infrastructure packages and **** film packages. This manuscript documents **** (**), the Layer-4 fleet-operations package that keeps the whole fleet measurable and gateable. The QUARTERMASTER owns the canonical suite roster as data ([@def:suite-roster]), reconciles it against live suite directories, runs per-package quality gates (one package per subprocess — [@prop:isolation]), reports per-repo git health, and emits the herdr provisioning roster. Fleet gate results are runtime diagnostics — never hand-authored metrics. Section [@sec:methodology] defines the gates, probes, and formalisms; [@sec:results] shows the measured fleet surface; [@sec:reproducibility] pins the determinism properties.
