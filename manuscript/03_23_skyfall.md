# Skyfall (2012) — SKYFALL

*film package · mission codename SKYFALL*. Mission **SILVA**: model the network intrusion paths into MI6's headquarters; detect the agent-list exfiltration burst in HQ traffic; compute the minimum severance cut that stops exfiltration; audit the aging legacy system exposure; schedule legacy patching under a daily budget; plan the Skyfall estate defense from its choke points.

## Concepts

cyber operations, legacy systems

## Abstract (imported from the package manuscript)

Skyfall is a PROJECT BOND mission-software package (film: Skyfall, 2012; codename **SILVA**) that models three linked threat surfaces through a purely deterministic computational core. The cyber layer models the intrusion paths an adversary can take into MI6's headquarters network, enumerating all simple routes and the minimum-hop / minimum-difficulty routes into the deepest system. It also detects the agent-list exfiltration burst in HQ traffic with a periodic-baseline CUSUM change-point detector, and computes the minimum severance cut (max-flow / min-cut) that stops the exfiltration. The legacy layer audits the aging infrastructure that still underpins operations, computing a closed-form exposure score per system, an aggregate fleet risk, and a greedy patch schedule that minimizes cumulative exposure under a daily budget. The physical-defense layer computes Silva's island hideout topology and the Skyfall estate's articulation (choke) points, then plans a defender assignment that covers them. All results are reproducible: fixed inputs, no random draws, and no wall-clock in any persisted metric. The package implements the frozen BOND-API ``MissionProvider`` contract and registers its gadgets with the BOND gadget registry, making the SILVA mission discoverable by the suite's orchestrator. ## Concurrency of the three threats The mission treats the cyber intrusion (internet → registry), the exfiltration burst (detected at hour 180, window 180–190), the legacy-system exposure (fleet size 5, mean exposure 0.62, patch back-log of 12 vulnerabilities), and the estate's choke-point defense (3 choke points, coverage 1.00) as one coordinated assault — the way the film depicts a single adversary reaching MI6's most sensitive systems through a chain of aging, poorly-segmented connections.
